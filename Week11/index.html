      <p>For this assignment I decided to learn how to communicate my Metro M0 Express to Unity by creating the pong game but the player is controlled by two buttons that are connected to my microcontroller. Also, each button would have an LED that would light up when you pressed the button. In Unity, I created a score for both the computer and the player, created a pause menu, a start menu, and a win text that will appear when either one reaches 5 points. During the process of creating this game, I learned how to create a computer AI that would basically follow the ball, control the player with some buttons and a microcontroller, and very specific things that I have to do in order to communicate the Metro M0 Express with Unity such as starting the game and then opening the Serial Monitor. I also learned to write something to the Serial Monitor and use that as an input to determine which direction the player paddle would have to move. I also learned to implement trigonometry into my Unity game, and communicate between scripts in order to make the movement and the whole game possible. In Arduino IDE, I learned to use the <code style="language-arduino">flush()</code>  command and keep practicing not using the <code style="language-arduino">delay()</code> function. I also looked up some tutorials in order to see the basics of communicating an Arduino UNO to Unity as well as to create the computer AI of the game and the ball movement. The first step in this process was to model the circuit in TinkerCad and make it in real life.</p>

      <p>To create this game, the first part was to simulate my circuit in Tinkercad. The circuit would basically consist of two buttons, two LED's, to 100 ohm resistors, and wires to hook each button or LED to a corresponding digital pin. I grabbed all of these materials from Tinkercad and started to model the circuit. Since the paddle could only move up and down, I figured that the breadboard should be in a vertical position. Also, I decided to make my buttons INPUT_PULLUP's so that I wouldn't need some extra resistors for them. I also decided to use a 3.3 volts power supply and the ground pin to connect the breadboard to the Metro M0 Express, and decided to make one of the buttons connect to digital pin 13 and the othe one to pin 12. Also, one of the LED's would be connected to digital pin 9 and the other one to digital pin 8. After modelling this circuit in Tinkercad, I started to model it in real life. It wasn't that hard, but I chose small wires this time so that they wouldn't interfere with your hand when you wanted to press the button. I also decided to use a green LED for the down button and a red LED for the up button. After all the wiring in real life was done of the circuit, I had to create the Arduino IDE code to send either a 1 or a 2 to Unity so that the paddle could move up or down.</p>

      <p>For this next step, I first opened Arduino IDE and created a new file. However, I didn't know how to communicate between my Metro and Unity so I started to look at some tutorials on YouTube, and found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_oLAvWfSI">person who is called inScope Studios</a> who was also using some buttons, but was using the Arduino UNO. Either way, I looked over this tutorial, and found that with some modifications, I could use it for the pong game. The first modification that I made was that I declared both buttons as INPUT_PULLUP's so they would basically always be HIGH unless one of them was pressed which would make them be LOW. Then, in the <code style="language-arduino">loop()</code>  function, I didn't want to use a delay function so instead I created two variables which are called previousMillis and offTime. This would allow me to use the <code style="language-arduino">millis()</code>  function and get rid of the <code style="language-arduino">delay()</code>  functions in the code. I also declared two LED's and whenever one of the two buttons was pressed, it's corresponding LED would light up. Now that the code was all done, I tested it to see if the LED's would work. It did but there was one problem that I encountered which was that the LED's would never turn off. After both buttons were pressed, both LED's would remain turned on which I didn't want to happen. To fix this, I created another if statement where it would check if both buttons were HIGH meaning that they weren't pressed, both LED's would be turned to LOW so that they would turn off. After making this slight adjustment, I ran the code again, and this time it worked. For debugging purposes, I would also make the Serial Monitor print either up or down, but after it worked, I just erased those lines of code. Now, that the Metro M0 express code and circuit was done, I only had to make the game in Unity 3D.</p>

      <p>The last step for this assignment was to create the pong game in Unity. In order for this to happen, I needed some images of the background, each of the paddles, and the ball. For this, I started to look for these images on the Internet until I came upon <a href="https://weeklycoder.com/2017/01/25/pong-clone-using-unity-5-5-tutorial/">The Weekly Coder</a> which basically made a file with all these images that I was looking for and after further looking, I found that he had a tutorial on how to create the movement of the ball and the computer AI which I had no idea how to make. After following his tutorial, I ended up with some weird problems which was that at the start of the match, the ball wouldn't start moving unless the computer moved the paddle. After looking into the code, I changed the operation to width/1.8f instead of 2 which in the end resolved this issue. Then, with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_oLAvWfSI">inScope Studios</a> I learned to create the player script and use the System.IO.Ports command to connect to my Metro M0. Then, I would check to see if I got a 1 or a 2 from the Serial Monitor on Arudino IDE, and would move the paddle up or down. For the movement of the ball, I learned to use the built in math functions such as converting from degrees to radians and radians to degrees since the cosine and sine functions only accept radians. Then, I had to check for any collisions between the ball and any of the paddles in order to change the direction in which it was moving and create this angle that would make the ball move in non-straight directions. I also had to constrain the movement of the paddles and the ball because the paddles could continue moving out of the screen as well as the ball. To do this, I looked at the max height and min height and just adjusted the position of each of them when they reached that coordinate. Finally, I created the UI which would basically consist of a start, end, and paused menu, all with the touch of the space bar. I made certain states of the game which were Playing, Launched, GameOver, and Paused. Depending on which state it was, certain text elemnts would appear such as "Press Space to Start" or "Press Space to Continue Playing." Finally, using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQLLfeUNsvQ&t=1s">The Weekly Coder's</a> tutorial on creating the computer AI, I learned how to track the position of the ball and make the computer go after it only in the y-axis meaning it would only go up or down and then check for a collision to change the ball's direction. After all of this was done, it was time to make the first test.</p>

      <p>After testing the pong game with the microcontroller, I found that something very weird happened. I clicked the play button on Unity and started to press the buttons. The LED's started to turn on and off but the player paddle wouldn't move on and the strange thing was that there was no error that popped up on Unity. I then looked over my Arduino IDE code to see if anything strange was happening but that didn't seem right since the LED's were turning on. After messing around with the Serial Monitor, I found that what I had to do was click the play button and then open the Serial Monitor. This way, the player paddle started to move up and down and the game resumed. However, after a certain period of time, the paddle would either go to the top or to the bottom and the buttons would stop working. At first, I thought it had to do with the game but after looking, I found that it was because the Serial Monitor was kind of put to "Sleep" so what I had to do was pause the game, and click the Serial Monitor which would wake it up and then resume the game. After fixing all of these problems, I decided to run it one final time to see if everything worked. The game is basically set so that whoever reaches 5 points first wins but if there is a tie, meaning that the computer has 4 points, and the player also has 4 points, the winning score increases by 1. After making the computer win, and then I won, I found that everything worked smoothly and was very happy to learn to communicate between my Metro and the pong game. Below is one my games:</p>
