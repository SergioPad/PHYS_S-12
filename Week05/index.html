      <p>For this assignment I decided to create an LED counter using the nine LED's that were included in my kit as well as one button. This idea came from the traffic lights around the city but decided to convert it into a counter. However, since I only had nine buttons, I only did number's 0 to 10 with number 10 having a special pattern. Also, I used various if statements to check if the button was pressed and print the current number to the Serial Monitor. In this assignment, I learned to use for() loops that were necessary to blink and turn on the LED's. I had a really fun time and even modelled the circuit on Tinkercad. </p>

      <p>The first step in this process was modelling the circuit in Tinkercad. I decided to start with two LED's and the button. After connecting everything to the bredboard and the Metro, I then proceeded to create the code. For this, I used Tinkercad's block code in order to build a basic skeleton for the two LED's and the button. However, I ran into a problem when creating the code which was using the for() loop and the if statements. When the for() loop was running and I included the if statements, it would only allow me to press the button once and the second LED would start to blink very fast. I tried to mess around with the order until I found the correct way which was to put the if statements outside the for() loop so the LED's would still blink but at a slower rate. After finishing this step in Tinkercad, I proceeded to Arduino IDE. </p>

      <p>After downloading this Tinkercad skeleton, I opened the code in Arduino IDE and started to add the seven LED's that were missing and completing the if statements for each number which is from 0 - 10. I also included what would happen if the button presses was greater than 10 which would be to turn the "number" variable to 0 and start the whole process again. The code turned out to be not that long but I had to make sure that it worked. I wired up everything into the Metro and the breadboard, plugged it into my computer, and plugged the code. The code ran smoothly but when it reached to number ten, it would blink eight of the LED's, wait for some 2 seconds, and turn on all LED's. However, when you had number 1, it looked almost the same. In order to fix this, I increased the delay to 3 seconds and made all the LED's blink faster so that you could notice the change between 1 and 10. After making these modifications, I uploaded the code again and this time, everything worked the way that I wanted. I opened the Serial Monitor and I had to press the button for about 2 seconds in order for the number to increase. All the numbers worked fine and I was finished. </p>
