      <br><p>Hello! My name is Sergio Padilla, I am a rising junior, and I currently live in Gudalajara, Mexico. However, I was born in Monterrey, Mexico, but now study at the American School Foundation of Guadalajara. I am 16 years old and the oldest of three. In my free time, I like to build puzzles, swim, spend time with my family, and build LEGO's. I am a huge fan of Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. One of my favorite movies is The Lion King and I love to visit Disney World. Some of my favorite subjects are mathematics, physics, and robotics. </p>

      <br><p>I have always liked and tried to do hands-on activities which is one of the things that I look forward from this course. Also, I hope to expand my programming skills since I have learned Python but wan't to learn new languages and skills. Using 3D printers and designing objects to print is a skill that I want to take away from this course. Playing around with Arduino and learning how to code it are some of the activities that catch my attention. Finally, I really look forward to getting a sense of what engineering is and combining it with other areas such as computer science and physics. I can't wait to start building and coding! </p>
