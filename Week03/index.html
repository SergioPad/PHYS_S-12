      <p>Before this assignment, I had no previous experience making circuits and didn't even know how to turn on a lightbulb both through code and automatically. I also had no idea how to use Arduino IDE in order to code both of my circuits. However, I found some tutorials made by people that work in Tinkercad that explained how to simulate circuits which I would first do and then make them in real life. Through these videos, I also learned how to code both in block form and text form which would later on be pasted in the Arduino IDE application in order to make thte circuits function. At the end of this assignment, I now feel more comfortable making circuits, using resistors, hooking up wires, and using buttons. Some of the videos that I watched are: </p>

      <p>The first circuit that I made was using a potentiometer and an RGB LED which would light up in different colors depending on how high or low I turned the potentiometer. The setup was pretty easy since I had already watched the Tinkercad potentiometer video. However, when I started to program the RGB LED, I encountered multiple problems. The first one was that all the legs were different so I had to look at an online picture that described what each leg meant. Then, I had to input RGB values for each color which are red, blue, and green. However, when I decided to make a color like purple, the LED was another color so I decided to use red, green, and white as the three different colors. Even though I ran this circuit in Tinkercad, the LED didn't match with the colors that I wanted it to light up as. Something that I learned to use while making this circuit was the serial monittor which I used to print the value of the potentiometer and see, when it would change colors. The first color ranges from 0 - 10, the second from 10 - 1000, and the last one from 1000 - 1023. Finally, I used block code to create a simple outline that I passed to the Arduino IDE application in order to create the final circuit. </p>

      <p>Then, I used the multimeter to measure the voltage of different parts of the circuit. It was a whole journey in order to use this instrument. I read some articles about how to measure voltage properly and even some videos in order to get a visual understanding of how it was done. When measuring the voltage, I would sometimes have to turn something on in order to get a reading since some colors weren't turned. For the final part of this circuit, I had to use Ohm's Law to calculate the current. I decided to calculate the current of each resistor and by using the multimeter and putting the black pin on one side and the red one on the other, I got a number which was the voltage. Then, since I used 100 ohm's resistors, I knew the resistance so I just divided the voltage by the resistance and got the current. Surprisingly, each current was different for each resistor. </p>

      <p>The second circuit that I made was to challenge myself. Since the only parameters that I had were to use materials from the kit, I decided to make a keyboard. Thankfully, I had nine buttons which were just enough to create this circuit. Each button contains three letters and depending on how long you press each button is the letter that is printed. However, since the alphabet only has 26 letters, and I had nine buttons, the 27th character was a space. The hardest part was wiring everything up since all the wires started to get mixed up and I almost ran out of wire for this circuit. Then, since I wanted to make the keyboard more interesting, I decided to add nine LED's of a certain color so that whenever you pressed one of the nine buttons, one of the nine LED's would light up to signal that the letter had been printed. The hardest part was making sure that only one of the LED's turned on as well as remembering where each wire was positioned since they all got mixed up. For this circuit, I used all the digital inputs as well as the analog ones. I was inspired by my smart watch which uses a button for three letters instead of having 27 buttons. For this, I first simulated the keyboard on Tinkercad in order to make sure that nothing would explode since I was working with limited pieces. I also created a very long outline using code block which I then passed on to the Arduino IDE and finished all the code.</p>

      <p>Finally, I used the multimeter to find the voltage of different parts in the circuit. However, in order to get a voltage, I had to press a button in order to light up the LED's so I would press the button and wait a few seconds in order to get a voltage reading. I also had to turn off the multimeter several times and try it with the ground and positive wires in order to get 3.3 volts because it sometimes would throw me random numbers. Then, for Ohm's Law, I calculated the current through three different LED resistors, but again, I had to push the button in order to get the voltage. I also used different kinds of resistors since I didn't have 9 100 ohm's resistors so I used a combination of 100 and 470 ohm's. At the end of this assignment, I feel confident in making circuits and will continue to play with them because there are an infinite number of circuits that you can make.</p>
