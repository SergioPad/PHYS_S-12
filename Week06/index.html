      <p>For this assignment I decided to focus on my final project which is making the little robots which are called microbots from the movie Big Hero 6. At first, I didn't know how realistic this could be until I talked to Nathan which gave me the idea of only making two of them and making them communicate with each other. I could then craete a simulation with multiple of them to show how it would look in real life. So then I got to work on the modelling part. I looked on the Internet some images of the little robot all fully assembled and decided to print one. Using the calipers, I decided to measure the diameter of the sphere's in the center and the length of each of its legs. I then opened Fusion 360 and created a new model. I decided to start by making one leg which would serve as a template for the arms and the head. During this process, I learned to use the angle tool when extruding in order to create the leg shape. After finishing the first leg, I was ready to proceed to complete the bottom part. However, I started to think of how I could join that leg with the bottom-center part. I conducted some research and found that in the movie, the way that everything was connected was through magnets. There was one problem, Fusion 360 doesn't allow magnets so I decided to create a little rectangle from the top part that connected the leg and the bottom-center part. After this, I created thet bottom part and I was ready to proceed. </p>

      <p>From this point, I just had to create the middle and top part. The trickiest part was rotating the pieces and making them look symmetrical since it wasn't parallel to any of the planes. I spent several hours making this model but it turned out pretty nice. For the middle part, I created another sphere and two of the legs that I had already made, but I just rotated and moved them so that they fitted with the middle sphere. I also created the two rectangles that connected each arm with the middle sphere. With this completed, I was only missing the top part which would be the hardest. When I got to making the face, I had to look up a Youtube tutorial on how to make a dome since my thought was to create a hollow sphere, cut it to a certain extent and insert a spehere onto it so that it could sping around. After learning to create the dome, I made a little cylinder that I used to cut the dome about 5 - 10 millimeters. After that had been done, I created a sphere and positioned it just right in order for it to barely fit. With this done, I just grabbed two legs and copied them onto the top while rotating them and moving them. I also included the little joining piece so that both ears couldn't fall out. After the top part was done, I learned to use the appearance feature that Fusion has and decided to go with black for all the body and yellow for the face. I then decided to try to make the eyes of the robot but after several tries, it looked like the face had popped out so I settled on leaving it like that.</p>

      <p>Before exporting this model in order to 3d print it, I decided to add a little simple microbot to the side in case that I would prefer to print only the microbot and not the whole thing already assembled. For this, I just had to copy and paste two of the legs, rotate them so that they were on the same line and looked symmetrical. I also added the little rectangles that would allow the two legs to snap with the sphere that goes in the middle. I also copiede a sphere from the body and placed it in between both pieces so that it looked like a microbot. Now, I was ready to export the file. At first, I couldn't find the "export as STL" in Fusion until I looked it up. I found that it was now called 3D Print so I did that and decided to include both the robot already assembled and the little microbot. I also decided to use a high quality, especially so that the shape of the spheres was accurate. After some seconds, the file was exported and ready to be 3D printed. </p>

      <p>After exporting the STL file, I opened Prusa Slicer, configured it for the MK3S model and dragged and dropped the STL file from Fusion. I ran into a problem which was that my model was bigger than the print bed so I learned to use the scale function and scaled it to 30% of the original one so that it fitted with the bed. This was the first time that I used Prusa Slicer and I learned a lot in the process. I then had to rotate my model in the Y and X axis so that it would lie in the print bed because if it was vertical, I was worried that the model will break because of the height, especially the arms and ears. I added support to the print bed so that the model could be completed without breaking. After configuring all of this, I sliced it to see how it would look and found that the spheres and bottom legs weren't perfect so I changed to 0.2 mm quality and it looked more realistic. After moving and adjusting these components, I was ready to "print" so I downloaded the G-code file and I was ready to print. However, since my 3D printer will not get until Tuesday afternoon and I have to assemble it, that part will have to wait. </p>

      <p>For the second part of this assignment, I looked at some photogrammetry apps that were recommended to us by Nathan. I was initially going to use Display.Land but it has been retired so I settled with SCANN3D. I also decided to scan an RD-D2 figure that I have around my house. The application was very complicated to use, especially since it was constantly asking you to become a PRO member by paying and when I was in the middle of taking photos to create the model, it would quit and close the application out of nowhere. There was this option of creating a 3D model from picture that you had taking previously but it was only a PRO member feature. After several minutes of trying, I could finally create my first model with over 20 pictures since I was receiving help from the application. However, when I opened it, only the front part of the R2-D2 had been 3D modelled so I had to repeat the whole process again with the application quitting in the process. After completing the second model, the top part with the antenna didn't look perfect but the body was pretty close to what it looked in real life. Also, a part of my floor also got modelled in the process but I was happy with how it turned out. After doing this, I learned that using a photogrammetry app is very hard and you have to take a lot of pictures in order for the model to be very accurate to the object in real life. </p>
