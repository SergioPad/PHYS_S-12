      <p>For the first part of the assignment, we had to watch a tutorial video in order to get comfortable with Fusion360. I decided to look on YouTube for some tutorials and found a 3-part tutorial where I created an object while also going through the basics and learning shortcuts like "m" for move, "q" for push/pull, and many more. The object was a container that had two holes on two sides and a lid. I also learned to import models such as the screws that were needed for the lid. This assignment taught we a lot since I had no prior experience modeling in any kind of software. However, as I watched the tutorials and looked up how to make other things for the rest of the assignment, I gained a lot of knowledge about Fusion360. The tutorials that I watched are: </p>

      <br><br><p>After watching all 3 tutorials, there were still some things that I didn't quite understand, especially since these videos are almost five years old so I had to solve those problems on my own. Also, at the end of the third tutorial, the person talked about animation, but I didn't feel ready for that so I just placed all the parts together and finished the object. The screws that are used in this model were imported but had to be positioned correctly in order for them to fit the holes that were made. The toughest part was making the holes, especially the one that was right in the middle of the edges since the tutorial did explain how to do it but I had another version of Fusion360 so I had to look it up. However, despite all adversities, I finally accomplished to do the object and it looks like this: </p>

      <p>The second part of the assignment consisted of modeling at least two parts from the kit. Since Nathan had already shared with us a Fusion360 folder with most of the kit parts already modeled, I decided to look at the ones that weren't there and quickly found that both LEGO pieces were missing. I grabbed them instantly as well as my calipers and started to measure them. However, I didn't want to make only two pieces so I then found that both batteries were not modeled as well as the battery holder for the double A battery. I got to work thinking that it would be an easy task, but it quickly became tougher than it looked. I started from easy to hard with the 9 volts battery first since it was just a rectangular prism with some cylinders on the top. However, getting the dimensions of these cylinders was quite hard since the calipers sometimes slipped and the number moved quite often. However, as time passed by, I started to get more comfortable using calipers until I could finally finish the first piece in Fusion360. Since this battery was not going to be assembled with any of the other objects that I had to model, I learned to add text to models and quickly printed the name of the battery and I was finished!</p>

      <p>Next, I decided to model the AA battery since it was just a simple cylinder. However, there was a problem when I decided to add text with the "Panasonic" name on it since it had to be curved. Since I never learned how to do that, I decided to not include the name of the battery in the model. The hard part with this battery was making those little dents that it has on the top since the fillet tool kind of did the trick but it wasn't perfect. Apart from that, I got accostumed to measuring circles with the calipers and the model turned out to be fine. However, there were some things that I needed to eye-ball since the calipers could get the measure such as the little dents that the battery had, but in the end, it turned out perfect, and it looks like a battery. Then, I modeled the 2 by 2 LEGO brick. The trickiest part was making the piece that sticks out of it since there are two circles, each with a different diameter, and there was this little rectangle at the end of this piece that created this hole. I had to eye-ball that part since the calipers couldn't measure that opening. The rest of the piece like the little circles and the square was quite easy. In every part, I just had to make sure that everything looked symmetric since it was square. However, the piece was modeled and it looked very realistic.</p>

      <p>The final models where the LEGO cylinder and the battery holder for four AA batteries. The LEGO cylinder was more difficult than the brick, especially because it had little circles between the ones that took most of the space. The toughest part was measuring the height that each cylinder had, especially the small ones since the calipers did not fit in those little holes. The big cylinders were quite easy since the diameter was quite big. However, the top part was very difficult, especially because of the design that it has so I decided to give it a try but I failed in the process. The lines became higher as they pointed towards the center which was something that stopped me during the process. In the end, I just decided to leave the whole structure without much detail, but it still looks accurate. The last model was the battery holder. This piece was broken up into two which consisted of the actual holder and the plug. The plug was pretty straight forward and I learned to use the "polygon" feature in Fusion360 in order to create the little octagon that sorrounded the circle. Again, the little dents that it has were very difficult to make but I got pretty close with the "fillet" tool. The holder was more complicated since it had a lot of little circles, rectangles, and weird patterns along the edge. However, using the calipers to measure the distance and diamter as well as the "fillet" tool, I was able to make a pretty close battery holder. The holder for each of the battery was also tough since it had a weird pattern as well as the plane that I needed to make it in was artifically created since the three planes given to me by Fusion360 did not work for that part. However, the design that it has at the bottom of the holder was so tiny that I didn't find a way to make it in Fusion360. Despite this, the model looks pretty accurate to the original one.</p>

      <p>Finally, I was just missing the assembly part of the components. I decided to make two assemblies. The first one was the battery holder were I joinec the battery plug, the holder, and four AA batteries. However, there was one thing that was missing and that was the cable that connected both of them. I had no idea that I could create cables in Fusion360 so I decided to search if it was possible and yes it was! I found a YouTube video which explained all of this and I used it. I could only create one of the two cables but it still turned out pretty well. Since everything was measured with calipers and very precisely, the batteries neatly went in their corresponding place. The second assembly was the LEGO wheel. For this one, I borrowed the wheel model that was already in the folder that Nathan shared with us. I was worried that it wouldn't fit with the other pieces that I made but all three of them matched perfectly. Since I had some spare time, I decided to look at how to make an animation in Fusion360 so I watched another quick tutorial and then passed this knowledge to the LEGO wheel assembly. I succesfully made the wheel turn and recorded it. In the end, both assemblies worked and turned out to be great!</p>
