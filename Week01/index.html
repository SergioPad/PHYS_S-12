      <p>For this first assignment, I learned html and css in order to create my own website for this course. Since this was my first time learning to make a website and using Sublime Text, I used the help of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> which had tutorials on how to make almost anything in html code as well as in css. Luckily, they also had some templates that I would later use to create the About Me page. However, before starting with the creation of my website, I decided to look at local fab labs. I knew that my school had a 3D printer, but they wouldn't let me use it since they were closed throughout the summer. After searching on Google, I found two possible candidates. The first one is called <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/labs/fablabgdl">loT Fab Lab</a> but I couldn't find any prices in order to go there, so I just simply sent an email and wait for the response. The second candidate was called <a href="https://guadalajaraconnectory.com/iot/">Guadalajara Connectory</a> but there was a problem. You had to send what you wanted to do and they would send it back, meaning that you couldn't actually go there and work. In the end, I think that I will stick to the things that I have at home and maybe consider buying a 3D printer.</p>

      <p>Since I had no idea how to start to create my website, I found a W3Schools template called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_me.asp">Simply Me</a> which I would use and change certain features. After copy and pasting the code into the index of the About Me page, I started to change the code. The first thing that I did was change the title and the picture to a picture of myself. Then, after looking at how to align text and create columns, I wrote a brief description of myself. I also learned the proper way of adding images which I started to add after trying for several mintues. However, I had no idea how to change the navigation bar in the template. For this, I relied on <a href="https://samjo4788.github.io/PHYSCI-70/index.html">Samantha's</a> website from last semester. In this process, I learned to find the source code of a webpage and after finally finding the code that made the navbar work, I changed it in the About Me page. The picture to the right shows the html code that creates the About Me page. Now that this page was finally done, I wanted to change my home page so that it included all the different assignments.</p>

      <p>After thinking about how I wanted my home page to look, I didn't know how to create buttons in html and the W3Schools tutorial didn't make sense to me. After looking at <a href="https://samjo4788.github.io/PHYSCI-70/index.html">Samantha's</a> home page, I wanted to structure mine like hers so I looked at her code and copied and pasted it onto my index file for the home page. However, after previewing it, the buttons didn't appear which was very strange so I decided to go to the lab session where Nathan explained what the file called "style.css" meant and after hearing this explanation, I knew that I needed to change this file in order for the buttons to appear. After looking for the code that Samantha had to create those buttons, I copied it into my style file and messed around with the colors until in the end, I decided that the buttons would be a cyan color. I also changed the navigation bar to be black and ordered all my folders and renamed them so that in the future, I could find everything perfectly arranged and could edit it faster. The picture to the left shows the HTML code that creates the home page. Finally, I just had to create a final project page where I would write down my ideas.</p>

      <p>In order to create that final project page, I copied the WEEK 01 tempalte and pasted it onto my final project page. You can see my ideas if you click on this <a href="../FinalProject/index.html">link</a>. Now that I have made my home page look nicer and documented my first assignment, I had to update my repository by pushing these changes. In the GitHub Desktop application, you can look at the changes that were made, but first you have to write a brief description of what you changed and then push it to your origin. There is also an option to create a new branch if you don't want to edit the main one which is the one that is already published. Below are images of the GitHub Desktop with all the changes that I made as well as the finished product. At the end of this assignment, I have a better understanding of HTML and CSS since I learned a lot such as comnenting lines that I didn't need, adding links to other parts of my website, putting images, and many more. However, I still have a lot to learn which I will keep doing over the course of these 7 weeks.</p>
