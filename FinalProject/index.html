      <br><p> This first idea would solve a problem that I encounter in my daily life whihc is getting wet when it rains. This idea is called the "Rain/Umbrella Vehicle." It would basically consist of a set of four wheels that would be connected a chassis. This vehicle would then have an umbrella sticked to the top of it and two sensors. The first sensor would tell the vehicle that it is raining. This could be changed by a computer that would directly tell the vehicle that it is raining. After the vehicle knows that there is rain in the environment, it would open the umbrella and using the second sensor, it would find a person that is standing in the rain or doesn't want to get wet and follow them wtih the umbrella. This would solve the getting wet in the rain problem and you wouldn't have to worry to carry an umbrella wherever you go. </p>

      <br><br><br><br><br><p> The second idea that I have is something that I have wanted to do. This idea comes from the Big Hero 6 movie and it's this self assembling and disassembling robot like the one that is used in the robot fights. I would try to use the design presented in the movie but at the same time adding some original ideas. The robot would be controlled using the computer that would tell it when to assemble and when to disassemble. I could even add some sort of remote control in order to move it around. However, instead of using the shpaes from the movie, it would be a series of boxes that could stack on top of each other by using magnets in order to create the little robot. At the bottom of two of the boxes, there would be wheels that would allow the robot to move around. The challenging part would be to make the robot disassemble since the magnets would already be attracted to each other as well as making the whole structure move. </p>
