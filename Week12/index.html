      <p>This week, we learned about molding and casting in one session. I was new to this whole technique since I had only seen videos, but never tried it in real life. The finished product was a mold made out of silicon of a gummy bear and a chocolate cast made out of Hershey's baking chips. Throughout this assignment, I learned how to create a mixture from which to make the mold out of, take out the figure after the mixture had dried, and make a cast out of it. Throughout the process, I also learned to be patient since I had to leave the mixture with the figure inside to dry for several hours, and precision so that the mold would turn out to be the way it was supposed to. In the end, I was very happy with the results and here is a final picture of the mold with the chocolate cast:</p>

      <br><p>To start the mold, I had to get the materials which in my case was <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sorta-clear-37/">SORTA-Clearâ„¢ 37</a> which allows me to create an edible cast since it is food safe. Now that I had the materials, I followed <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/09_casting/casting.html">Nathan's guide</a> on how to make a mold of a certain object. The first step was getting a container were the object could fit in. Since the gummy bear wasn't very big, I found a cardboard box that was just the right size since I also had limited molding material. Since the box had all its edges sealed, the container was already waterproof. The next step was pasting the gummy bear to the bottom of the box. For this, I used double sided tape and just stuck the head of the bear to the bottom of the box. This is so that one, the object doesn't float on top of the mold material and so that the molding material doesn't trap the object inside of it. Then, I had to prepare the silicon mixture which was pretty easy to make. Using a popsicle stick and the measuring cup that came with the kit, I added 75 cc of part A and part B since the ratio between both parts is 1:1. However, I first stirred both bottles for about 5 minutes and after both of them had been poured to the cup, I stirred the whole thing for 10 minutes. The next thing was to pour the silicone mixture into the cardboard box. The mixture covered the bear and gave a little more so that when I took it out, the mold wouldn't break. Now that the mixture had already been poured in, I had to leave it to dry.</p>

      <p>After hearing Nathan's recommendation of leaving the mold to dry overnight, that is exactly what I did so on Friday's lab session, the mold was ready to be taken out. In that lab session, Nathan explained to us how to take out the mold and make a cast with it. After carefully following his instructions and taking the mold out, I flipped it and saw that the bear was kind of inside of it but the double tape had made a whole that would allow me to take it out. Using an exacto knife and with a lot of precision, I was able to take out the silicone mixture that was above the bear and take out the bear completely. After examining the mold, I found that I had correctly molded the gummy bear and was ready to make a cast out of it. Below are two pictures, one of the mold with the gummy bear inside after I cut out the extra silicone and the other one of the final mold. In the end, I had just made my first one part mold! </p>

      <p>Since the mold was food safe, I decided to try to make a chocolate cast. After looking around in my kitchen for chocolate, I found Hershey's baking chips so I decided to give it a try. Using a pan, I heated the baking chips that were inside a glass container and added some milk to the mixture. After the chocolate mixture was done, I grabbed a wood square were I positioned my mold and poured in the chocolate mixture. I made the right amount of chocolate mixture so the cast would turn out to be perfect. I put the mold with the mixture inside the refrigerator and waited for several hours for it to solidify.</p>
